# CIS_Group_Project
Scenario: Your company has been hired to implement an information system for the newly
constructed Madison Hotel at JMU. Your company has assigned your team to this project, to
work with the client, develop a prototype, and expand the prototype out into a working system.
Part 1 of this prototype will be a console-based application (text only) with developed Classes,
instance objects, and arrays, with menus and inputs. Below you will find example output of a
sample run of the prototype.
Client Needs:

After discussing the project with the client, the following new system (“To-Be” System) needs
have been elicited:
• The system should ask for a username/password for a person to log in. For now, this first
version of the system will be used by both Hotel Employees and Guests of the hotel
(Guests may use a PC kiosk in the lobby, for example)
• Employees who log in should be able to do the following:
o Run a booking report for all rooms or one room in particular. The “All Rooms”
report should show summary information for each room (short description, # of
times booked, $ generated, etc.).
o Check a guest OUT of the hotel (which would free up a room)
o Create a Guest account (for new guests – don’t forget about the ValueGuest
savings club accounts too!)
 Edit Guest Account information – username cannot be changed!
o Create a new Employee account (We just hired someone!)
 Edit Employee account information.
o Create, Edit, and make a Room inactive (We would never delete a room, just take
it out of the system for a while) and make a room Active again. Inactive rooms
cannot be booked.
• Guests who log in should be able to do the following:
o Book a room.
o See a report of what rooms they have booked.
o Edit their personal information – Guests cannot change username/passwords!
